# Division2Statistics

# Explenation

Recently I was kinda bored searching up my Division 2 statistics through Google, so I made this Electron application that kindly abuses
tracker.gg to bypass that whole previous hassle.

# How to build

Change the config.json username entry with your username.

Run: ```npm run make``` to make an Windows build.

Then head into the ```out\division-2-statistics-win32-x64``` folder and either run the application, or:
Install it through the installer inside: ```out\make\squirrel.windows\x64```
